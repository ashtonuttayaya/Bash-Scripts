IMPORTANT CHECKS
          Make sure you have
          1) shared the root, saleadmin and salesmgr passwords with your partners
          2) set the privileges for the salesadmin and salesmgr accounts
             TO check this, log into mysql as root and use the commands
             SHOW GRANTS FOR 'salesadmin'@'localhost'; 
             SHOW GRANTS FOR 'salesmgr'@'localhost';
