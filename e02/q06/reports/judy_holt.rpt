MEMO: 
FROM: R. Scott
TO:   All State Employees

Please pay no attention to recent news reports about my administration banning the use of the terms climate change and global 
warming in official documents, letters or emails. There is no official ban. 

All communications among state employees are routinely diverted for review by my staff members 
who, when appropriate, re-phrase the content. For example, residents in Miami Beach are blaming so-called climate change for 
raising the sea level and causing frequent flooding of streets and neighborhoods. The crisis poses an undeniable threat to the 
tourism and real-estate industries, and Ive acted swiftly. At my direction, the state Department of Environmental Protection will 
henceforth define the situation in Miami Beach as a permanent high tide. This isnt censorship. Its creative editing. 

As I have said many times, Im not a scientist so I cant say for sure that the climate is changing because of human activity. Im 
also not a reader, so I am basically incapable of researching the subject on my own. Another word Im accused of banning is 
sustainability, which refers to the wise and measured use of environmental resources. Or so Ive been told. Again, theres no 
official ban of that term. If someone can just explain to me what sustainability means - and, more important, whats the darn 
point. - I might allow it to appear in a memo or perhaps a low-level email. Please understand that part of my duty as governor is 
to polish the image of the Sunshine State, and make it a welcoming place for businesses who might want to relocate here and take 
advantage of our laughably low wages.

We in state government shouldnt frighten people away with alarmist speculation. Under my watch, no official documents 
shall ever suggest that Miami Beach is sinking underwater - not as long as a single manhole remains dry. This editorial vigilance 
applies to other hot-button issues, as well. The other day I intercepted a copy of a memo that unnecessarily contained the word 
pollution, in reference to silted waters being pumped in biblical quantities from Lake Okeechobee toward Floridas coastlines. 
Certainly we can all agree that pollution is a term that has negative connotations. It implies not only that our famed wild waters 
arent clean and safe, but that somebody is at fault for polluting them. As your governor I dont like playing the blame game - and 
its got nothing to do with the fact that my re-election campaign took truckloads of money from U.S. Sugar and other companies that 
treat Lake Okeechobee as a septic tank. 

Personally, Im fond of collateral spillage. Its bad for business if state officials toss around inflammatory expressions such as 
algae bloom, when the same aquatic phenomenon could be more gently described as decorative greening. Likewise, the unappealing 
phrase red tide has been overused by the wildlife officers who patrol our busy beaches. These incidents should be more benignly 
reported as floating fish hospices. Not being a scientist, I find myself confused by tricky technical terminology like nitrogen 
and phosphorus. People who went to science school tell me these are real chemical elements found in the waste of farms and 
ranches, and unhealthy in heavy concentrations. However, using such weird mumbo-jumbo puts Floridians on edge about whats 
happening to their water. Wouldnt it be better to focus on all the harmful chemicals that arent being dumped into the Everglades. 
For instance, gasoline (G on the periodic table I was given). Water sampling shows almost no gas, leaded or unleaded, in the 
public aquifers. 

Climate change, global warming, sustainability - these are interesting theories, and I encourage all state workers to 
discuss them freely with your families, in the privacy of your own homes. Again, Im not a scientist. Im just a governor in way 
over his head, and proud to be there.
